# model

After finished DeepLearning course of Andrew NG, I did this very first NN project. 

The project contains two parts, first one is the basis of the project. NN with two 
hidden layers. Their size is changable. The output layer coninst of ten nodes because 
there are ten numeral. I used ReLu in the hidden layers and  softmax at the output.At 
the end of the training I saved the weights and biases on txts.

The second file is UI part. I re-evaluate the input of the users data via saved weights
and biases. Actually I get some support from the chatgpton this part so it may has some bugs.
